# WycliffeData
Wycliffe data sets are cleaned and applied to machine learning algorithms for predicting patterns in data and determining insights


The finished product is inside of app2.py in the directory DashFull. It is designed so that it holds the uploading component and 
accesses other classes for other components in the application (map, scatter plot, table, k means clustering, line graphs). 

So far it has been tested with file ICTO_Datasets.csv which is the CSV version of Wycliffe's Excel File ICTO_Datasets.xlsx.
The Lattitude and Longitude Scatter Plot and Ministry Monthly Budget Amount vs EndDate are hard coded to work with this dataset but the map 
can work with any dataset that has Postal Codes of the United States. 

They are refered to as app_map or app_scatter.
